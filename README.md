# EDA Student Performance (Case Study)
## Standard Procedure for real life case study :-

#### Life cycle of Machine learning Project

- Understanding the Problem Statement
- Data Collection
- Data Checks to perform
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data Pre-Processing
- Model Training
- Choose best model

### 1) Problem statement
- This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.


### 2) Data Collection
- Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977 (example for this project)
- The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

### 2.1) Import dataand required packages 
### 2.2) Import the csv data and convert it into pandas dataframe 
### 2.3) Dataset Information
- gender : sex of students  -> (Male/female)
- race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B,C, D,E)
- parental level of education : parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
- lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced) 
- test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
- math score
- reading score
- writing score

### 3. Data Checks to perform

- Check Missing values
- Check Duplicates
- Check data type
- Check the number of unique values of each column
- Check statistics of data set
- Check various categories present in the different categorical column

### 4.Useage of Graphs 
- clear visualization
- Better story telling
- easily understood by the customer (business owner)

### 5. Conclusion/ Insights
- summarization:-The conclusion provides a concise summary of the key findings and insights presented throughout the document. It allows the reader to quickly grasp the main takeaways without having to revisit the entire content.
- It enables the writer to reemphasize and highlight the most important points or findings. By reiterating key insights, the conclusion reinforces the central message the author wants to convey.
